			<br>
			
			<p class="desc">I am a highly capable programmer and game designer with more than 13 years of experience.
			I have worked independently, and with a team, to successfully plan, coordinate, implement, and develop content
			and technical systems on projects ranging from weekend-long game jams to multi-year long award winning AAA games.
			As a goal-driven, positive person, I strive to create the highest quality work. I am a resourceful professional
			with experience designing and programming in visual and text-based languages, and have led teams through the
			development lifecycle process. I've written design documents and scripted instructional web pages; mentored and
			tasked team members; as well as evaluated and wrote reports on content quality and technical systems effectiveness.
			I am certified in HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and Game Scripting. I've programmed game content and cinematic sequences;
			complex ETL interfaces in PL/SQL; web services and automated tools in Java; and an entire virtual reality (VR) game in C#.
			Currently, I'm leading the development of a global medical application for both VR and WebGL, as well as a second VR game in C# using Unity.</p>

			<br>
			
			<p class="desc">"Steve is one of the stronger developers on the team and is always going above
			and beyond to expand his knowledge even further... and has even begun to pick up on several areas
			of DBA expertise. He is always willing to take on any new challenges and is an extremely exceptional
			independent worker. I know I can depend on him when we face issues occurring in production. He has
			saved literally hundreds of hours. Steve also delivers exceptional code fixes, scripts,
			and documentation, ensuring that we meet our SLA's with his quality work. It's wonderful to work with
			such an independent, trustworthy, and exceptional employee." ~ Kara Donaldson, Operations Support Manager</p>
			
			<p class="desc">"Steve is one of the best technical designers and scripters I've worked with.
			He was stuck with a set of rough tasks and managed to master them. His work was far above what
			I could have hoped for and he handled numerous difficult issues with a great attitude and work
			ethic. I would have him on any team I'm part of." ~ Bill Sullivan, Senior Designer</p>
			
			<p class="desc">"Any tasks assigned to Steve were always handled efficiently and he often went
			the extra mile, improving upon the initial design...offering solutions on how to get the same
			or better results. I often felt that his work was well above his level, allowing me to assign
			him the same tasks I would a much more senior designer and expect great results." ~ Nik Johansson, Senior Designer</p>
